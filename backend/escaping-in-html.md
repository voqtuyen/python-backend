# Escaping in HTML


- Escaping in HTML means, that you are replacing some special characters with others. In HTML it means usually, you replace e. e.g `<` or `>` or `"` or `&`. 
These characters have special meanings in HTML.
- Imagine, you write:
`<b>hello, world</b>`
And the text will appear as <b>hello, world</b>. But sometime you don't want to have this behaviour. So you replace the < and >.
`&lt;b&gt;hello world&lt;/b&gt;`. This will result in <b>hello world</b>
