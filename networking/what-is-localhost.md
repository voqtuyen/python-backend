### What is loopback IP address?
An address that sends outgoing signals back to the same computer for testing. 
In a TCP/IP network, the loopback IP address is 127.0.0.1, and 
pinging this address will always return a reply unless the firewall prevents it. The loopback address allows a network administrator to treat the local machine as if it were a remote machine
